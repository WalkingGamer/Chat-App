# Let's Chat!
This is a Simple Chat App Front Project. Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
User Can Ask Some Questions and This Chat App Will Respond.  
This Type of Apps can be used for some questionnaires or similar plans. This structure of the program can be decisive in academic, medical or administrative form.

# Use of Functions
```
function botReply(responseMessage){

```
I Used BotReply Function to make the App Responsive. 
Then We Define a Variable Called processMessage. 
```
function botAlgorithm(processMessage)
```
Then with this function, we are going to build a set of questions. also app has a set of answers. The responses were defined using randomFeeling and randomGreeting variables.
